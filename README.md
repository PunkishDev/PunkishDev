# \<h1>Hello! I'm Jordyn, also known as Punkish\</h1>

I'm a computer science student in Ontario, Canada.
For as long as I can remember, I've had a passion for computers, and specifically, software development. I began my personal study of software dev when I was 15 years old, starting with Java, which wasn't retained, then finding passion within Game Development. I found interest primarily in backend development, eventually participating in a few game jams, making projects that in hind sight have a lot of room for improvement.

Recently I've been working more with web dev using JavaScript for backend server functionality, and Vite React for frond end reactivity.
